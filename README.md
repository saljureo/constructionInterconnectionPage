# constructionInterconnectionPage
This page is designed to connect users who want to contact construction contractors. Whether the user needs to repair an electrical device, renovate a bathroom, remodel a kitchen, or handle any other construction-related project, this platform serves as a bridge to the right professionals.
I would like that the interface the user interacts with operates with a large-language-model so that it can receive the info from the user, possibly prompt for missing information and giving feedback to confirm that the request was understood fully.
I'm gonna use this project to learn how to do this.
Added one line on GitHub.
I'm actually learning how to use Git. Will update locally and also update directly on GitHub something different, and see how to solve that merging issue. 
Erased old line on local and added this new one on local as well.
