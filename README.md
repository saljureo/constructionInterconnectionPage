# constructionInterconnectionPage
This page is designed to connect users who want to contact construction contractors. Whether the user needs to repair an electrical device, renovate a bathroom, remodel a kitchen, or handle any other construction-related project, this platform serves as a bridge to the right professionals.
I would like that the interface the user interacts with operates with a large-language-model so that it can receive the info from the user, possibly prompt for missing information and giving feedback to confirm that the request was understood fully.
I'm gonna use this project to learn how to do this.
New line on GitHub.
